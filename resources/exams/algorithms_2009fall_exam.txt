Problem 1

Let G = (V, E) be a directed acyclic graph where edges are assigned non-negative weights. You
can assume that V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and if (vi, vj) ∈ E then i < j. Let the weight of edge (vi, vj)
be denoted as wij. The weight of a (directed) path in the graph is deﬁned as the product of the
weights of all the edges on that path. Assume an adjacency list representation of G.

1. Give O(|V | + |E|) time algorithm to compute the sum of the weights of all paths from v1 to

vn.

2. Let 1 < i0 < n be a ﬁxed index. Give O(|V | + |E|) time algorithm to compute the sum of

the weights of all paths from v1 to vn passing through vi0.

3. Let 1 < i0 < j0 < n be two ﬁxed indices. Give O(|V | + |E|) time algorithm to compute the
sum of the weights of all paths from v1 to vn passing through vi0 but not passing through vj0.

Problem 2

A Non-deterministic Finite Automaton N is a 5-tuple N = (Q, Σ, qs, F, δ) where Q is a ﬁnite set
of states, Σ is a ﬁnite alphabet, qs ∈ Q is the start state, F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states, and
δ : Q × Σ (cid:55)→ P(Q) is the transition function. The language accepted by an NFA N is denoted as
L(N ). A Deterministic Finite Automaton is an NFA as above except that the transition function
is δ : Q × Σ (cid:55)→ Q.

1. Given two NFAs N1 = (Q1, Σ, qs

1, F1, δ1) and N2 = (Q2, Σ, qs

2, F2, δ2), show how to construct

an NFA N such that the set of its states is Q1 × Q2 and L(N ) = L(N1) ∩ L(N2).

2. Given an NFA N = (Q, Σ, qs, F, δ), show how to construct a DFA D such that L(D) = L(N ).

3. Given an NFA N = (Q, Σ, qs, F, δ), show how to construct an NFA N (cid:48) such that L(N (cid:48)) =

L(N ) where L(N ) denotes the complement of the language L(N ).

Note:

• P(X) denotes the power set of X, i.e. the set of all subsets of X.

• The cartesian product of two sets X and Y is deﬁned as X × Y := {(x, y) | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }.

• The deﬁnition of NFA above does not allow the so-called ε-moves. So ignore ε-moves.

• Proofs of correctness are not necessary. Give a formal description of NFAs/DFAs that you

may construct. Partial credit will be given to description in words.

Problem 3

Note that a tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Show that for any tree T with 2n + 1 vertices,
there exists a vertex v ∈ T such that after removing v (and all edges incident on it), each connected
component of T \ {v} has at most n vertices.

Hint: A simple greedy-style strategy actually ﬁnds such a vertex.

Problem 4

We need to maintain a collection C of rooted trees such that the following operations can be
implemented eﬃciently:

• BREAK: Given a tree T ∈ C, remove T from the collection C. Delete its root and add all the
subtrees of the root as (distinct) trees in the collection C. The root is also added to C as a
single-node tree. The cost of this operation is k if k was the degree of the root.

• UNION: Given two distinct trees T1, T2 ∈ C, remove them from C, construct a tree T whose
set of nodes is the union of the sets of nodes of T1 and T2, and then add T to collection C.
The cost of this operation is 1.

Assume that initially C consists of n single-node trees.

1. Give an implementation that ensures that for any tree T in the collection, the height of T
is at most O(log |T |) where |T | is the number of nodes in T . You need to describe how to
implement the UNION operation and prove that the upper bound on the height works.

Assume that the height of a single node tree is zero.

2. Prove that for a sequence of m BREAK and UNION operations, the total cost is O(m + n).

Problem 5

A directed Hamiltonian cycle in an n vertex directed graph is a directed cycle containing exactly n
edges that includes every vertex exactly once. You can assume that the DIRECTED HAMILTO-
NIAN CYCLE (DHC) problem is NP-complete:

DHC :=

(cid:110) (cid:10)G(cid:48)(cid:11) | G(cid:48)(V (cid:48), E(cid:48)) is a directed graph that has a directed Hamiltonian cycle

(cid:111)
.

An edge coloring of a directed graph G(V, E) is a map π : E (cid:55)→ {Red, Blue}. Let the AMERICAN
HAMILTONIAN CYCLE problem (AHC) be the following:

AHC :=

(cid:110)

(cid:104)G, π(cid:105) | G(V, E) is a directed graph with an even number of vertices along with

an edge coloring π and G has a directed Hamiltonian cycle with no

two consecutive edges of the same color

(cid:111)
.

Show that AHC is NP-complete.

Problem 6

Part I:

Suppose z ∈ {0, 1}k and zi denotes the ith bit of z. For a subset S ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k}, S (cid:54)= ∅, let

fz(S) :=

(cid:77)

i∈S

zi.

In words, fz(S) is the XOR of all bits of z in the subset S. Now think of z ∈ {0, 1}k as a string
chosen uniformly at random (i.e. every bit of z is independently set to 0 or 1 with probability 1
2
each). Answer the following questions along with a justiﬁcation.

1. Fix a subset S ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k}, S (cid:54)= ∅. What are the following probabilities?

Prz [fz(S) = 0] ,

Prz [fz(S) = 1] .

2. Fix two distinct subsets S, T ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k}, S (cid:54)= ∅, T (cid:54)= ∅, S (cid:54)= T . What are the following

probabilities?

Prz [fz(S) = 0 and fz(T ) = 0] ,

Prz [fz(S) = 0 and fz(T ) = 1] ,

Prz [fz(S) = 1 and fz(T ) = 0] ,

Prz [fz(S) = 1 and fz(T ) = 1] .

Part II:

Let G(V, E) be an undirected graph where |V | = n = 2k − 1 and V is identiﬁed with the set of all
non-empty subsets of {1, 2, . . . , k}, i.e.

V := {S | S ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k}, S (cid:54)= ∅}.

For any choice of z ∈ {0, 1}k, we get as above a function fz(·) : V (cid:55)→ {0, 1} which can be thought
of as a partition of V into two parts. Let CUT[fz] denote the number of edges of G(V, E) that are
cut by this partition. Prove that

where Ez[·] denotes the expectation over the random choice of z.

Part III:

Using Part II or otherwise, design a deterministic polynomial (in n) time algorithm that ﬁnds a
partition of the graph G(V, E) that cuts at least |E|

2 edges (the graph is as in Part II).
