CSCI-GA 3520: Honors Analysis of Algorithms

Final Exam: Thu, Dec 19 2013, Room WWH- 312, 3:30-7:30pm.

• This is a four hour exam. There are six questions, worth 10 points each. Answer all questions

and all their subparts.

• Please print your name and SID on the front of the envelope only (not on the exam booklets).
Please answer each question in a separate booklet, and number each booklet according to the
question.

• Read the questions carefully. Keep your answers legible, and brief but precise. Assume

standard results.

• You must prove correctness of your algorithm and prove its time bound if asked.
The algorithm can be written in plain English (preferred) or as a pseudo-code.

• The graphs are undirected in Problems 1, 6 and directed in Problems 3, 4.

Best of luck!

Problem 1 (Graphs are undirected)
Let T (V, E) be a tree and w : V → R+ be a non-negative weight function on the vertices. The
weight of a subset of vertices is the sum of weights of the vertices in it. Design a polynomial time
algorithm to ﬁnd an independent set with the maximum total weight.

Note: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. An independent set is a subset of vertices such
that there is no edge between any pair of vertices in this subset.

Problem 2

Given an array A[1..n] with n integers, we want to locate for each i = 1, . . . , n, the smallest index
b(i) such that A[i] < A[b(i)] and i < b(i). If no such index exists, let b(i) = 0. We can view the
function b(i) as another array B[1..n].

E.g., let n = 7 with A given by

i:
A[i]:

1
3

.

Then B[1] = 3 since A[1] < A[3] and A[1] > A[2]. The output is

i:
B[i]:

Design an O(n) time algorithm that given an array A computes the corresponding array B.

Hint: Use a stack.

Problem 3 (Graphs are directed)

Let G(V, E) be a directed graph. A vertex r ∈ V is called a root of G if every vertex in V is
reachable from r via a (directed) path in G.
Design an algorithm that ﬁnds a root of G if one exists, and otherwise outputs “NO ROOT”.
Assuming G is represented using adjacency lists, your algorithm should run in time O(|V | + |E|).

Hint: You could ﬁrst consider the case when the graph is acyclic.

Problem 4 (Graphs are directed)

The goal of this problem is to travel from home to a store, purchase a gift, and then get back home,
at minimal cost.
Let us model this problem using a directed graph. Let G(V, E) be a directed, weighted graph, with
nonnegative edge weights w : E → R+. The weight of an edge represents the cost of traversing
that edge. Each vertex v ∈ V also has an associated cost c(v) ∈ R+ which represents the cost of
purchasing the desired gift at that location.
Starting from “home base” h ∈ V , the goal is to ﬁnd a location v ∈ V where the gift can be
purchased, along with a path p from h to v and back from v to h. The cost of such a solution is the
cost c(v) of the location v plus the weight w(p) of the path p (i.e., the sum of edge weights along
the path p).
Design an algorithm that on input G(V, E), including edge weights w(·) and costs c(·), and home
base h ∈ V , ﬁnds a minimal cost solution. Assuming G is represented using adjacency lists, your
algorithm should run in time O((|V | + |E|) log |V |).

Problem 5

The 4LIN problem consists of n Boolean (i.e. {0,1}-valued) variables x1, x2, . . . , xn and m equations
where each equation is of the form:

xi ⊕ xj ⊕ xk ⊕ xℓ = 1,

1 ≤ i < j < k < ℓ ≤ n.

Here ⊕ denotes the xor operation.

1. If the variables in some ﬁxed equation are assigned {0, 1} values uniformly and independently,

what is the probability that the equation is satisﬁed? Justify.

2. Show that there is an assignment to (all the n) variables that satisﬁes at least m

2 equations.

3. Now assume that there exists an assignment that satisﬁes all the equations. Design a poly-
nomial time algorithm to ﬁnd such an assignment (i.e. one that satisﬁes all the equations).
What is the complexity?

Hint: Part 3 is not necessarily dependent on the previous parts. Think of linear systems.

Problem 6 (Graphs are undirected)

A forest is a graph with no cycles. For a graph G(V, E) and a subset U ⊆ V of its vertices, let G|U
denote the induced subgraph of G on the set of vertices U (i.e. the graph with the vertex set U
and edges that are precisely the edges of G with both the endpoints in U ). Show that the following
problem, called FOREST, is NP-complete:

FOREST = {(G(V, E), k) | G(V, E) is a graph and ∃U ⊆ V, |U | = k such that G|U is a forest}.

Hint: You may use a reduction from the INDEPENDENT SET problem. Recall that

INDEPENDENT SET = {(G′

(V ′, E′

), k′

) | G′

(V ′, E′

an independent set of size at least k′

) is a graph that has
}.

Such a reduction maps an instance (G′(V ′, E′), k′) of the INDEPENDENT SET problem to an
instance (G(V, E), k) of the FOREST problem such that G′ has an independent set of size (at least)
k′ if and only if G has a forest of size (at least) k.
